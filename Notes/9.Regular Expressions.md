### Regular Expressions in Depth

Regular expressions (regex) are a powerful tool for working with text data, allowing you to match, extract, and manipulate strings based on patterns. Python's `re` module provides functions to work with regular expressions.

#### Basic Patterns

- `.`: Matches any character except a newline.
- `^`: Matches the start of the string.
- `$`: Matches the end of the string.
- `*`: Matches zero or more repetitions of the preceding character.
- `+`: Matches one or more repetitions of the preceding character.
- `?`: Matches zero or one repetition of the preceding character.
- `{m,n}`: Matches between `m` and `n` repetitions of the preceding character.
- `[abc]`: Matches any character in the set (a, b, or c).
- `[^abc]`: Matches any character not in the set (a, b, or c).
- `A|B`: Matches either A or B.
- `( )`: Groups a subpattern.

#### re Module Functions

- `re.match()`: Determines if the regex pattern matches at the beginning of the string.
- `re.search()`: Searches the string for a match to the regex pattern.
- `re.findall()`: Returns all non-overlapping matches of the regex pattern in the string as a list.
- `re.finditer()`: Returns an iterator yielding match objects for all non-overlapping matches of the regex pattern in the string.
- `re.sub()`: Replaces all occurrences of the regex pattern with a specified string.

##### Example Usage

```python
import re

pattern = r"\d+"

# Match
result = re.match(pattern, "123abc")
print(result.group())  # Output: 123

# Search
result = re.search(pattern, "abc123def456")
print(result.group())  # Output: 123

# Findall
result = re.findall(pattern, "abc123def456")
print(result)  # Output: ['123', '456']

# Finditer
result = re.finditer(pattern, "abc123def456")
for match in result:
    print(match.group())  # Output: 123, 456

# Sub
result = re.sub(pattern, "-", "abc123def456")
print(result)  # Output: abc-def-
```

#### Special Sequences

- `\d`: Matches any decimal digit (0-9).
- `\D`: Matches any non-digit character.
- `\s`: Matches any whitespace character (space, tab, newline).
- `\S`: Matches any non-whitespace character.
- `\w`: Matches any alphanumeric character (letters and digits) or underscore (_).
- `\W`: Matches any non-alphanumeric character or underscore.
- `\b`: Matches the boundary between a word and a non-word character.

#### Flags

Regex flags allow you to modify the behavior of the regex engine.

- `re.IGNORECASE`: Makes the regex case-insensitive.
- `re.MULTILINE`: Makes the `^` and `$` characters match the start and end of each line instead of the whole string.
- `re.DOTALL`: Makes the `.` character match any character, including newlines.

##### Example with Flags

```python
import re

pattern = r"^abc"
string = "ABC\nabc"
result = re.findall(pattern, string, re.IGNORECASE | re.MULTILINE)
print(result)  # Output: ['ABC', 'abc']
```
