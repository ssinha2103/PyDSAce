### Lambda Functions in Depth

Lambda functions are anonymous, single-expression functions that allow you to create compact and concise functions in Python.

#### Syntax

Lambda functions are defined using the `lambda` keyword, followed by a comma-separated list of arguments, a colon, and an expression. The lambda function can take any number of arguments but should only contain a single expression.

```python
lambda arguments: expression
```

#### Example Usage

```python
# Simple lambda function
add = lambda x, y: x + y
print(add(3, 5))  # Output: 8

# Lambda function with multiple arguments
multiply = lambda x, y, z: x * y * z
print(multiply(2, 3, 4))  # Output: 24

# Lambda function with default argument values
greet = lambda name="John": f"Hello, {name}!"
print(greet())        # Output: Hello, John!
print(greet("Jane"))  # Output: Hello, Jane!
```

#### Lambda Functions in Higher-Order Functions

Lambda functions are often used as arguments for higher-order functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()`.

```python
# Using lambda with map()
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squares = list(map(lambda x: x**2, numbers))
print(squares)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

# Using lambda with filter()
even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4]

# Using lambda with sorted()
students = [
    {"name": "Alice", "age": 25},
    {"name": "Bob", "age": 20},
    {"name": "Charlie", "age": 22}
]
sorted_students = sorted(students, key=lambda x: x["age"])
print(sorted_students)  # Output: [{'name': 'Bob', 'age': 20}, {'name': 'Charlie', 'age': 22}, {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}]
```

#### Limitations

While lambda functions are useful for simple operations, they have some limitations compared to regular functions:

- Lambda functions can only contain a single expression.
- They cannot include statements or include complex logic.
- Lambda functions cannot contain assignments or use the `return` keyword.

In cases where more complex logic or multiple expressions are needed, it's better to use a regular function defined with the `def` keyword.

Lambda functions provide a concise way to create simple, anonymous functions in Python. They are particularly useful when combined with higher-order functions and when a short, throwaway function is needed.
