### Magic Methods in Depth

Magic methods, also known as dunder (double underscore) methods, are special methods in Python that allow you to customize the behavior of your objects. They enable you to define how objects should be created, represented, compared, and more.

#### Object Initialization: `__init__`

The `__init__` method is called when an object is created. It is used to initialize the object's attributes.

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
```

#### Object Representation: `__str__`, `__repr__`

The `__str__` method defines the "informal" or "user-friendly" string representation of an object, while `__repr__` defines the "formal" or "developer-friendly" representation.

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.name}, {self.age} years old"

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Dog(name='{self.name}', age={self.age})"
```

#### Object Comparison: `__eq__`, `__ne__`, `__lt__`, `__le__`, `__gt__`, `__ge__`

These magic methods allow you to define how objects should be compared for equality and ordering.

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def __eq__(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, Dog):
            return self.age == other.age
        return False

    def __lt__(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, Dog):
            return self.age < other.age
        return NotImplemented
```

#### Arithmetic Operations: `__add__`, `__sub__`, `__mul__`, `__truediv__`, `__floordiv__`, `__mod__`, `__pow__`

These magic methods define how objects should behave when used with arithmetic operators.

```python
class Vector:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __add__(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, Vector):
            return Vector(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)
        return NotImplemented

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Vector({self.x}, {self.y})"
```

#### Container Operations: `__len__`, `__getitem__`, `__setitem__`, `__delitem__`, `__contains__`

These magic methods define how objects should behave when used as containers.

```python
class CustomList:
    def __init__(self, items):
        self.items = list(items)

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.items)

    def __getitem__(self, index):
        return self.items[index]

    def __setitem__(self, index, value):
        self.items[index] = value

    def __delitem__(self, index):
        del self.items[index]

    def __contains__(self, value):
        return value in self.items
```

#### Context Managers: `__enter__`, `__exit__`

These magic methods enable you to create objects that can be used with the `with` statement as context managers.

```python
class Timer:
    import time

    def __enter__(self):
        self.start = time.time()
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
                self.end = time.time()
        self.elapsed = self.end - self.start
        print(f"Elapsed time: {self.elapsed} seconds")

with Timer() as timer:
    import time
    time.sleep(2)  # Output: Elapsed time: 2.0001 seconds (approximately)
```
These are some of the most common magic methods in Python. They allow you to customize the behavior of your objects, making your code more flexible and expressive. For a complete list of magic methods and their uses, refer to the official Python documentation.
