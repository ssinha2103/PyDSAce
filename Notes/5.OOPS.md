### Object-Oriented Programming in Depth

Object-oriented programming (OOP) focuses on organizing code around objects and their interactions. It promotes modularity, reusability, and abstraction.

#### Classes and Objects

Classes are blueprints for creating objects, which are instances of a class. They define the properties and methods that the objects possess.

##### Class Variables and Instance Variables

```python
class Dog:
    species = "Canis lupus familiaris"  # Class variable shared by all instances

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # Instance variable unique to each instance
        self.age = age
```

##### Class Methods, Static Methods, and Instance Methods

```python
class Dog:
    species = "Canis lupus familiaris"

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    @classmethod
    def get_species(cls):
        return cls.species

    @staticmethod
    def bark():
        print("Woof!")

    def describe(self):
        print(f"{self.name} is {self.age} years old.")
```

#### Inheritance and Polymorphism

Inheritance allows one class to inherit properties and methods from another class. Polymorphism enables a single interface to represent different types or support multiple methods with the same name.

##### Inheritance and Method Overriding

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name, species):
        self.name = name
        self.species = species

    def make_sound(self):
        print(f"{self.name} makes a generic animal sound.")

class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        super().__init__(name, "Dog")
        self.age = age

    def make_sound(self):  # Method overriding
        print(f"{self.name} barks!")
```

##### Multiple Inheritance

```python
class A:
    def method_a(self):
        print("Method A from class A")

class B:
    def method_b(self):
        print("Method B from class B")

class C(A, B):
    pass

c = C()
c.method_a()  # Output: Method A from class A
c.method_b()  # Output: Method B from class B
```

##### Polymorphism and Duck Typing

```python
def play_sound(animal):
    animal.make_sound()

animal1 = Animal("Generic", "Animal")
animal2 = Dog("Fido", 3)

play_sound(animal1)  # Output: Generic makes a generic animal sound.
play_sound(animal2)  # Output: Fido barks!
```

##### Abstract Base Classes

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Animal(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def make_sound(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        print("Woof!")

dog = Dog()
dog.make_sound()  # Output: Woof!
```
