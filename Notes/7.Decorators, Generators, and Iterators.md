### Decorators, Generators, and Iterators in Depth

These advanced Python concepts are essential for writing efficient and flexible code.

#### Decorators

Decorators are functions that take another function as input and return a new function that usually extends or modifies the behavior of the input function.

##### Function Decorators

```python
def uppercase_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        result = func()
        return result.upper()
    return wrapper

@uppercase_decorator
def greet():
    return "Hello, world!"

print(greet())  # Output: HELLO, WORLD!
```

##### Class Decorators

```python
class UppercaseDecorator:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func

    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        result = self.func(*args, **kwargs)
        return result.upper()

@UppercaseDecorator
def greet():
    return "Hello, world!"

print(greet())  # Output: HELLO, WORLD!
```

#### Generators

Generators are a special type of iterator that allow you to create iterators using functions instead of classes. They use the `yield` keyword to produce a sequence of values on-the-fly, without having to store them in memory.

##### Generator Functions

```python
def fibonacci(limit):
    a, b = 0, 1
    while a < limit:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

for number in fibonacci(10):
    print(number, end=" ")  # Output: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8
```

#### Iterators

Iterators are objects that implement the iterator protocol, which consists of the methods `__iter__()` and `__next__()`. They allow you to iterate over a collection of items, one at a time.

##### Custom Iterator

```python
class Counter:
    def __init__(self, start, end):
        self.start = start
        self.end = end

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        if self.start > self.end:
            raise StopIteration
        self.start += 1
        return self.start - 1

counter = Counter(0, 5)
for number in counter:
    print(number, end=" ")  # Output: 0 1 2 3 4 5
```
