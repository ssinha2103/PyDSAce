### Exceptions in Depth

Exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program and alter the normal flow of control. Python uses exceptions to handle errors and other exceptional situations.

#### Built-in Exceptions

Python provides several built-in exceptions, such as:

- `ValueError`: Raised when a function receives an argument of the correct type but an inappropriate value.
- `TypeError`: Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type.
- `IndexError`: Raised when a sequence index is out of range.
- `ZeroDivisionError`: Raised when the second argument of a division or modulo operation is zero.
- `KeyError`: Raised when a dictionary key is not found in the set of existing keys.
- `FileNotFoundError`: Raised when trying to open a file that does not exist.
- `AttributeError`: Raised when an object does not have the specified attribute or method.
- `NameError`: Raised when a local or global name is not found.

These are just a few examples of the many built-in exceptions in Python. For a complete list, consult the [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#bltin-exceptions).

#### Raising Exceptions

The `raise` statement allows you to raise an exception in your code.

```python
def divide(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        raise ValueError("Division by zero is not allowed.")
    return a / b

try:
    result = divide(10, 0)
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)  # Output: Division by zero is not allowed.
```

#### Handling Exceptions

The `try` and `except` statements are used to catch and handle exceptions.

```python
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero.")  # Output: Cannot divide by zero.
```

You can catch multiple exceptions using parentheses.

```python
try:
    result = 10 / "5"
except (TypeError, ZeroDivisionError) as e:
    print(e)  # Output: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'int' and 'str'
```

#### Else and Finally Clauses

The `else` clause is executed if no exception is raised in the `try` block. The `finally` clause is always executed, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not.

```python
try:
    result = 10 / 5
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero.")
else:
    print("The division was successful.")  # Output: The division was successful.
finally:
    print("This is always executed.")  # Output: This is always executed.
```

#### Custom Exceptions

You can create your own exceptions by subclassing the built-in `Exception` class.

```python
class MyCustomException(Exception):
    pass

try:
    raise MyCustomException("This is a custom exception.")
except MyCustomException as e:
    print(e)  # Output: This is a custom exception.
```

Understanding exceptions in Python is essential for writing robust and fault-tolerant code. To learn more about exceptions and their handling, refer to the official Python documentation.
